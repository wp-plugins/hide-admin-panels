=== Hide Admin Panels ===
Contributors: businessxpand
Tags: administration, admin, user, users
Requires at least: 2.7.1
Tested up to: 2.9.2
Stable tag: 0.9.8.3

Allows you to hide admin menus from specific users.

== Description ==

Scans your WordPress admin sidebar for menu items and gives you option to hide them from a specific user. This will only work on WordPress versions greater than 2.7.1 as it relies on the newer admin look.

Any of the following can be hidden: posts, media, links, pages, comments, appearance, dashboard, plugins, users, tools, settings, and as of version 0.9.5 can now hide third party plugins.

The plugin is also compatible with [Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/ "Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu") (v3.3.1) plugin. Please ensure that Ozh' Admin Drop Down Menu plugin is activated before hiding menu options.

Please note that this is only an aestheic effect, if your user has something installed in their browser that allows them to change the CSS of the page they will be able to unhide the menu item. This also does not prevent them from accessing the hidden menu sections directly by web address.
