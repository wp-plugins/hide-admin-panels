Allows you to hide admin menus from specific users.

== Description ==

Scans your WordPress admin sidebar for menu items and gives you option to hide them from a specific user. This will only work on WordPress versions greater than 2.7.1 as if relies on the newer admin look.

Any of the following can be hidden: posts, media, links, pages, comments, appearance, dashboard, plugins, users, tools and settings.

Please note that this is only an aestheic effect, if your user has something installed in their browser that allows them to change the CSS of the page they will be able to unhide the menu item. This also does not prevent them from accessing the hidden menu sections directly by web address.
